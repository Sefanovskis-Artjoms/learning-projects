# Sudoku
This is a small pet project where I have created a sudoku game on the web.
 <br> 
In this project, I tried to exercise use of OOP and event listeners. 
 <br> 
There are fue levels available, once you have completed the level there will be text "Complete" in the header 
 <br> 
In input fields only numbers from 1 to 9 are allowed other input is restricted and if you try to insert more numbers, then the existing one is replaced with a new number 
 <br> 
Any input is saved if you move through levels
