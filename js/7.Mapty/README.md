# Mapty

This is one of my udemy javascript course projects. In this project, you can keep track of your workouts on the map.
<br>
I have followed the course and wrote initial markup, workout adding and displaying functionality by folowing teacher instructions.
After completing the course I have decided that I want to return to this project and expand it with some functions that seemed interesting and worth while to implement.

<br>
Features that I wrote independently:

<ul>
  <li>Sidebar markup that isn't related to workout cards</li>
  <li>Single workout deletion</li>
<!--   
  <li>Deletion of all workouts</li>
  <li>Zooming all workouts in one screen</li>
  <li>Filtering workouts by type</li>
  <li>Sorting workouts by field values</li>
  <li>Displaying error message when submitted incorect data in the workout form</li>
  <li>Hiding workout form when a user presses "escape" or with cursor somewhere else that is not map or form</li>
  <li>Displaying temporary marker when the user presses on the map and form appears</li>
  <li>Edit workout information</li>
  <li>Adding path on the map for the workout as additional feature in edit section</li> 
  -->
</ul>
