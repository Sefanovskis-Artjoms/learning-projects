# learning-projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing a collection of pet projects! Here, you'll find a variety of projects that reflect my journey as a developer. Whether they are personal experiments, small projects that I did for others, tutorials, or self-initiated creations, each project represents a valuable step in my learning process.

## About the Repository
This repository serves as a comprehensive portfolio of my coding adventures. It includes projects of varying complexity, showcasing my growth and evolution as a developer. I believe in capturing my learning journey, from simple early projects to more intricate endeavours.

## Project Structure
The projects are organized into different categories based on technology stacks or skills that I want to showcase more than others. As I want to be crystal clear about what I did on my own and what not, projects that were made with the help of the tutorials will be marked accordingly. Copied projects(ones that I followed a tutorial for) are also showcased here because I am convinced that copying is also an amazing way to learn. I want to demonstrate that I am aware of possible solutions to different problems though I did not come up with my own, I would be capable of replicating it fully or partially if seen ever again.

## How to Navigate

Explore individual project folders to find README files providing detailed information about each project.
Identify projects marked as "tutorials" to see my hands-on learning experiences from more experienced developers.

## Getting Started
Feel free to explore any project that catches your eye. Each project's README file includes information on its purpose, features, and setup instructions.
