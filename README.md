## About the Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing a collection of my learning projects! Here, you'll find a variety of projects that reflect my journey as a developer. Whether they are personal experiments, small projects that I did for others or tutorials that I followed, each project represents a valuable step in my learning process.

## Project Structure

The projects are organized into different categories based on technology stacks or skills that I want to showcase more than others. As I want to be crystal clear about what I did on my own and what not, projects that were made with the help of the tutorials will be marked accordingly. Copied projects(ones that I followed a tutorial for) are also showcased here because I am convinced that copying is an amazing way to learn. I want to demonstrate that I am aware of possible solutions to different problems though I did not come up with my own, I would be capable of replicating it fully or partially if seen ever again.
