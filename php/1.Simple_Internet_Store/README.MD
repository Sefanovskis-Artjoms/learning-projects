# Simple internet store

This project was my diploma work for Riga State Technical School. Main idea of this project was to create some product that would include database and processing of it's data. So the choice of internet store was the most obcious to me and seemed simplest from available options at the time.

Original documentation for this project can be found in the folder "dokumentacija" and original readme file can be found as "README_OLD.txt"

## Brief project description

The internet store is made for imaginary company The Glow Light that is located in Telford, England.
Payments in the store are not processed, in its place when user places order, he actualy places reservation as the sold products are actualy a services for the cars. For that reason user also has to keep record of hes cars in the profile that includes some vital infromation about the car that would be usefull before taking car into the service. And for users there is a possibility to see the record of their reservations, cars and comment as the user can leave the testimonials about recieved services and company itself.

For the Admin, he can see the record of the reservations and filter them by their state, which he can change. As with the record of the services, users and comments(admin has to approve the comment before it can be displayed on the website). Also on top of that in the admins section exist main panel containing important KPI's and graphs with some usefull information.

After the completion of the service of during it, admin can also create and edit the report of that service for user to check what exactly has been done or what the technicians wanted to add about the job
